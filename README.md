## History

First major user of Zaphpa, in production, was [NPR](http://npr.org)'s API. Zaphpa hugely benefited
from this use through meticulous bug-fixing, various contributions and overall creativity of the
wonderful NPR software teams.

Zaphpa is now used by a variety of organizations worldwide. If you use Zaphpa and want to be listed here,
